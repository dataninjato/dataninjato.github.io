DataCamp Competition submitted on 03-Feb-22
 
 ## ðŸ“– Background
You work for an early-stage startup in Germany. Your team has been working on a redesign of the landing page. The team believes a new design will increase the number of people who click through and join your site. 

They have been testing the changes for a few weeks and now they want to measure the impact of the change and need you to determine if the increase can be due to random chance or if it is statistically significant.

 ## How it is done
We apply hypothesis testing and statistical power calculation given the observed alpha, sample sizes, means and effect size parameters.
